## Аккорды песни Rainbow KItten Surprise - It's Called: Freefall

---

### [Verse 1]

     D

Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
 
I said to the devil, "Devil do you like drums?

    G

Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
 
He said only "sundown, Sundays, Christmas"
 
    D

Some day's end when I need a few friends
 
Now and again I could never hope to keep them

    G

Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
 
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been
 
### [Verse 2]

    D

Don't get me venting on friends who resent you 'cause 
 
All you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to

    G

They thought was a necklace and reckless they fell into 
 
Hell where you both hang with nothing to do but

    D

Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
 
Fuck this, let gravity win like

    G

You could leave it all behind, even the Devil need time alone sometimes
 
### [Refrain]

    D

You could let it all go, you could let it all go

            G

It's Called: Freefall
 
It's Called: Freefall
 
### [Verse 3]

      G

Called to the Devil and the Devil said quit

    E

Can't be bothered better handle your shit

    Bm

Keep about your wits man, keep about your wits

    D

Know yourself and who you came in with

    G                         Em

Can I sit down I've been hustling all day
 
I can't even count how many souls I've made

    Bm

Off the same deal you on

               D

Remember: The Devil ain't a friend to no one

     G

But fun, true
 
### [Refrain]

                      Em

You could let it all go, you could let it all go

It's Called: Freefall

         Bm                     D                        G

It's like 2 A.M. and the bars all close at 10 in hell, that's a rule I made"

                                 E                       Bm

Anyway, you say you're too busy saving everybody else to save yourself

                        D

And you don't want no help, oh well

                 G

That's the story to tell
 
### [Refrain]

You could let it all go, you could let it all go

           Bm

It's Called: Freefall

        D         G

It's Called: Freefall

                       Em

You could let it all go, you could let it all go

       Bm                    D
